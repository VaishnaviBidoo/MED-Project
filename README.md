<p><i> This Python code creates a GUI application using tkinter for encoding and decoding messages. It allows users to input a message, a private key, and choose between encoding or decoding mode. The application provides visual elements such as labels, entry fields, and buttons for user interaction. The encoding and decoding functions utilize base64 encoding. Users can reset the input fields, view results, and exit the application.</i></p>
